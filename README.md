# Roll20KOTOR
A custom character sheet for the Roll20 website based on the menus and character creation of the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic games.

Attached is a folder with images of the project as it currently stands, the pictures "5" and "6" which correlate to the "feat-tab" and the "power-tab" respectively, are in their complete forms.
The "skill-tab", shown off in the picture "4" is close to completion, only needing the skill descriptions, and some adjustments to the roll buttons.
The "armor-tab", shown off in pictures "2" and "3" have a lot of work to do, as each of the eleven buttons on the right each need their own sections that are displayed on the left.
